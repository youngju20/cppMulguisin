# Mulguisin

A C++ implementation of the Mulguisin (MGS) cluster finding algorithm. It has been developed by Prof. InKyu Park.
This program must need Qhull and HDF5 library.

## Build instructions

To build the project, simply run:

```bash
make
```

## Run MGS

```bash
./run_mgs linking_length input_file output_file_name
```

We also provide `run.sh` to run MGS more easily
